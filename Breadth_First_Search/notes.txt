BFS is simple when you understand DFS

but one very important thing I have noticed is when you are updating values while doing BFS, its best to update the value before appending to queue
in other words instead of doing

    x, y = queue.pop()
    ret[x][y] = ...whatever

    if x>0: queue.append((x+1,y))
    if y>0: queue.append((x,y+1))

its better to do

    x, y = queue.pop()

    if x>0:
        ret[x+1][y] = ...whatever
        queue.append((x+1,y))
    if y>0:
        ret[x][y+1] = ...whatever
        queue.append((x,y+1))


some issues with overwrites can occur otherwise. to be frank, I dont get why, I cant visualise it, but I've seen the results so good enough
Key example of this issue is 01_Matrix.py
