This file is just some notes for myself, what I learned or things to think about or whatever comes to mind that feels worth writing down.

For dfs the format is pretty basic

Main Function

    leftValue = func(root.left)
    rightValue = func(root.right)

    logic = leftValue, rightValue, root.val        could be adding, seeing max of which, or min, or w.e we need for the question

    return based on logic

    
often the return and logic are in one line, eg return max(leftVale, rightValue)


Helper functions may be needed if our logic requires more variables than the main function is designated.
    look at Count good nodes for an example
        we need to track the max value on the current path, but our initial func doesnt have an input var for it, so we create a helper func and recursively use that instead
